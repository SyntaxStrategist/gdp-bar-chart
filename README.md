# GDP Bar Chart

A data visualization project that displays a bar chart of the United States GDP over time. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes D3.js to create a bar chart representing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States across a range of years. The data is sourced from an external API, and the chart includes interactive tooltips for additional information, providing a better user experience.

### Features

- **Dynamic Bar Chart**: Visual representation of U.S. GDP data over time.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over any bar to view the specific GDP value and date.
- **D3.js Integration**: Scales and axes are created using D3.js for accurate data representation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and data manipulation.
- **D3.js**: Data visualization library for creating dynamic charts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need a basic web server. You can use **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code or a simple server with Node.js.
